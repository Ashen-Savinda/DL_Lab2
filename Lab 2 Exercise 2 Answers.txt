1.The more hidden nodes in a neural network, the better it can learn complex patterns. But too many nodes can lead to overfitting, where it learns the training data too well and struggles with new data.
 More hidden nodes = better learning, but risk of overfitting.

2.Increasing hidden nodes improves accuracy up to a point, then plateaus or declines( slight fluctuations ).
